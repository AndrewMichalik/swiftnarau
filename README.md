==========

An extremely simple stock market price fetcher written in Swift.

Why did I make this? 

Because I found it difficult to follow any single example of swift out there. They all seem to conflict with each other, so this app is meant to be something that's easy to follow to get people out there started on iOS development in swift. I assume the reader has some kind of programming background such that even if they've never done any iOS development before this project will be able to teach them the following after getting a swift-supporting XCode version installed:

* How to make a simple HTTP GET request
* Passing a function pointer as an argument(an experienced dev will note swift is stricter about this than gcc's C on linux)
* How to write a unittest(in Xcode, press command+U to run the unittests)
* How to deal with async events in your unittest
